MEMENTO

Description:
The goal of this project was to create a web application that allows users to view and interact with the spiciest memes. Memento was made to give users an interactive platform where they can view trending and popular memes, upload their own memes, and interact with other users using profiles.

Repository organization and structure: 
We organized and gave structure to our github repository by creating a views folder as well as keeping all of the server and js files in the same place.

How to Run: 
Go to heroku link below:

Continuous Integration: 
Throught the development of Memento, we initially used Google Docs in order to continuously update our code and share code with each other. During the last couple of weeks of the project, we switched to Github and used that for our continuous integration.
